##Build a function that will take an array of filenames (as string) and return an array of array. Each array will provide 3 informations about the image file: the full filename, its name and the extension. (See the example below)

#Detect the image files based on the end of the filename which is their format (extension).
#Image files are defined as jpg, gif, png, tiff, svg and bmp. So "puppies.jpg" is a image file while "puppies.html" is not.

function imageFilter(arr) {

}
P: array of strings containig file names

R: should retun array with image files names broken down into "name", "extension" and non image files returned as null

E: imageFilter(["index.html", "favicon.gif"])
return [null, ["favicon.gif", "favicon", "gif"]]

P:
1)loop through array and check which strings are img files
2) if not img file add to new array as null 
3) if string is an img file add original string to new array
3a) strip string (imgName .extension) add pieces to new array
4) return new array
