# LeetCode
Instructions: In a deck of cards, each card has an integer written on it.
Return true if and only if you can choose X >= 2 such that it is possible to split the entire deck into 1 or more groups of cards, where:
Each group has exactly X cards.
All the cards in each group have the same integer.

var hasGroupsSizeX = function(deck) {
    1) sort each num into separate array then
        use map() get the separate array

    2) count/compare array length
        use forEach() to go through each array crated with map
        create conditional to compare array.length
    3) return true or false
  
};
